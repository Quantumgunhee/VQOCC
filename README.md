# VQOCC
This is an implementation of Variational Quantum One-Class Classifier (VQOCC) in our preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02674 
It uses open-source quantum circuit simulator https://qibo.readthedocs.io/

It represents the variational quantum algorithm for one-class classification problems using Quantum Autoencoder structure.
