# VQOCC
This is an implementation of Variational Quantum One-Class Classifier (VQOCC) in our preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02674 
It uses open-source quantum circuit simulator https://qibo.readthedocs.io/

It represents the variational quantum algorithm for one-class classification problems using Quantum Autoencoder structure.

The code implementation includes the applications to a Handwritten digit dataset with scikit-learn and Fashion-MNIST dataset.

You have two options for data encoding scheme, one is amplitude encoding and the other is Flexiblem Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding.
